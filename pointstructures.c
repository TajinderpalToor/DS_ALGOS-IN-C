Structure Type: struct tag is the name of the structure type. Just like you can have an int or float variable, struct tag is the type for your structure variable.

Pointer Declaration: struct tag *st_ptr; declares a pointer variable st_ptr that can hold the address of a structure of type struct tag. The *st_ptr part means that st_ptr is a pointer capable of referencing a struct tag object.

Address of the Structure: The expression &my_struct gives you the memory address of the my_struct variable. The & operator is used to obtain this address.

Pointer Assignment: When you do:

c
Copy code
st_ptr = &my_struct;
youâ€™re assigning the address of my_struct (which is &my_struct) to the pointer st_ptr. Now, st_ptr points to the memory location where my_struct is stored.


*/


/*

then doing, *st_ptr will dereference and give you the actual values of the structure
then you can use the .whatever to get the value 

*/
// below is the same as my_struct.age
int age=(*st_ptr).age;

// aklternative to the above is st_ptr -> 63;



return 0;
