binary trees organized specifically for searching
start at the root and then go level by level until you find your node
if the node is greater than your desired go left
so left is values decrease, right is values increase

- O(lg n), n is the number of nodes in tree is the worst case, if the tree is balanced
- balance means shprt as possible tree for the given number of nodes

- as the tree becomes more and more unbalanced it becomes O(n)


Implementation and Analysis of Binary Search Trees:

- hard to keep tree balanced but one method is to keep it as a
AVL TREE ( ADELSON VELSKII AND LANDIS)
