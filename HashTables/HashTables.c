/*

Hash Tables Notes:

- basically an array where the data is accessed through a key
- mapping between set of all possible keys and positions in the array
using a hash function 

- give hash function a key an you get a hashing code or hash value, hash codes are always integers
- calculating hash value and indexing into array is constant time this is good for constant time searches
- direct addressed: no two keys will generate the same hash code 
- number of entries in a hash table is small relative to the universe of possible keys
- two keys map to same position they collide
